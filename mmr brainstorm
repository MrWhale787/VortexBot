stats are given

Kills
Deaths
win
Score

stats we can get

obj (estimate)
true kills


things we dont want:
  kd based
  win loss based


allScores = [linkedList]

if you win but int, you should not gain as much as carry            mmr
if you win but int.                                                 mmr * (0.5*someratio)
if you lose but int you lose a shit ton.                            mmr * -someratio
if you lose but do well you gain as much as lose but int.           mmr * -(0.5*someratio)



raw mmr =
     objScore = (score-kills*100)
     trueKills = inverseTeam[deaths]
     contribution = objScore/teamObjScore
     expectedContribution = 1/teamPlayers
     contributionRatio = contribution/expectedContribution
     KD = kills/Deaths
     if contributionRatio > 1:
          scoreMMR = 8 + (5*((contributionRatio - 1 )*4)
     else:
      scoreMMR = 8*contributionRatio


      if (KD * 2.5) > 7:
          kdMMR = 7 + (KD)
      else:
        kdMMR = KD*2.5


      rawMMR = kdMMR + scoreMMR
